# Monty-Hall-Simulation
A python script simulating the monty hall problem. Watching the movie "21", I was introduced to the Monty Hall Problem.
While the idea of the problem is simple, I found it hard to accept the idea. Using Python, I created a script that tested
the problem over multiple iteration and found that the probability of finding the correct door does in fact increase when the player switch doors.
